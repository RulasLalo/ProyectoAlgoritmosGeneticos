This is a small videogame which was made applying genetic algorithms and automata theory.

If you want to run this project, the class Principal.py is the main.

At First you'll see a menu where you must choose a type of spaceship, every option correponds to a fitness function:
1.- f(x)=x^2
2.- f(x)=ABS |(x-5)/(2+sen(x)|
3.- f(x)=sen(x)

Once chosen you must choose what kind of spaceship do you want. In this case, I classified them as follows:

1.- The maximun value will give you three lives.
2.- If the value is less than the maximun value and greater equal than the average value then you will have two lifes.
3.- If the value is leen then the average value you will have one life.

Then you will start the adventure...

Every node of the automatha corresponds to each step of the game.

The image of the automatha there is in ProyectoAlgoritmosGeneticos/Videojuego/aut√≥mata.png

NOTE: The transition of the node q4 to q2 is given by 1. And well, it still has many bugs, but I will repair them and I will finish this project.
